1. DOCUMENTATION
-----------------
To save space in transmission, documentation files must be generated
by running the docg.py script provided (docg.py) with this command: 
python docg.py
Having done this, navigate into docs and open index.html.

2. USE
-------
Most of your work will probably be done in Main.py.
However, don't be afraid to play around with anything and everything!
